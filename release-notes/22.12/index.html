<h1>CheriBSD 22.12 Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the Fall 2022 (22.12) release of the CheriBSD operating system.  As well as a
general update of the baseline FreeBSD OS from which CheriBSD is derived, we
have introduced several new research components which will be of interest to the
CHERI and CheriBSD community:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory-safe adaptation of Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) and Panfrost device
driver, which enable a Morello-based desktop system using on-board GPU and HDMI.
These drivers may be used with hybrid or pure-capability kernels.</li>
<li>An initial set of graphics and desktop CheriABI software packages such as
Wayland and portions of KDE to get you up and running with a memory-safe desktop
environment. These components remain under active development, and we anticipate
continuing package updates after the CheriBSD release.</li>
<li>An early research prototype of Library Compartmentalization
(https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheripedia/wiki/Library-based-Compartmentalisation),
which implements an alternative run-time linker running shared objects in
libraries. This implementation is very much a work-in-progress, and is provided
to enable research at other collaborator institutions needing easy access to the
prototype. It is neither complete nor intended to be secure.</li>
<li>Improved pluggability of experimental heap temporal memory-safety support,
which is not yet merged into the main development branch, but will now be easier
to use by downloading an alternative kernel and heap allocator libraries
provided by Microsoft.</li>
<li>Support for a newer version of GDB in CheriBSD, which provides generally
improved debugging support including Morello code disassembly and hardware
watchpoints. We have also added support for memory tag access from the debugger
on live targets as well as core dumps.</li>
<li>Alpha support for ZFS file systems including support for boot environments.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While CheriBSD is by definition an experimental research operating system, the
above features – other than GDB improvements – are not yet considered to be
mature. They are being made available as an early release to facilitate
collaboration, but will not be suitable for a general Morello audience until the
following release.
</p>
<p>
As with previous releases, the default CheriBSD kernel on Morello ships with
debugging features enabled, which should be disabled by booting a non-debug
kernel before any performance benchmarking is performed.
</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a USB hub is plugged in (including embedded hubs in USB keyboards) the
system will pause on boot due to a firmware bug. Some people find they can
bypass this pause by pressing Enter on a USB keyboard attached to the Morello
desktop system. Others find they must unplug the hub to boot.</li>
<li>ZFS support is lightly tested and only known to work with hybrid kernels
(the default). While pure-capability kernels can create ZFS filesystems, they
hang if a ZFS file system is used at the root file system. The on-disk format is
believed to be stable, but it is not impossible that future releases will be
unable to read pools created by this release, particularly pools created on
pure-capability kernels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Morello as a Desktop</h2>
<p>
New installations of the latest CheriBSD release have an option to enable the
desktop packages during the install process.
</p>
<p>
If you have already installed the latest version of CheriBSD but did not install
the desktop packages you can add them later; log in as root or use sudo to add
the following packages to the system:
</p>
<pre>
<code>pkg64c install cheri-desktop</code> <b>(provides DRM, Wayland and the general GUI system)</b>
<code>pkg64 install cheri-desktop-hybrid-extras</code> <b>(provides Firefox and other applications)</b>
</pre>
<p>
Make sure that your user ID is in the video group; if not, use:
</p>
<pre>
<code>pw groupmod video -m username</code>
</pre>
<p>
Add the following lines to /boot/loader.conf:
</p>
<pre>
<code>dtb_load="YES"</code>
<code>dtb_type="dtb"</code>
<code>dtb_name="/boot/dtb/arm/morello-soc.dtb"</code>
</pre>
<p>
Ensure that a USB keyboard (without an internal hub, see Known Issues) and
mouse, as well as an HDMI monitor capable of handling full-HD input (all modern
monitors), are connected to the desktop.
</p>
<p>
Reboot your system and you will be presented with a graphical login screen.
