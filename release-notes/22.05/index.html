<h1>CheriBSD 22.05 Release Notes</h1>
<p>
The CHERI Project is pleased to announce our Getting Started release of CheriBSD
(22.05).  The Getting Started release has been timed to coincide with the May
2022 availability of Arm's CHERI-enabled Morello Board prototype.
</p>
<p>
CheriBSD is an adaptation of FreeBSD for CHERI, providing an experimental
operating system with a rich use of the Morello prototype architectureâ€™s
features. It is intended to be a platform for general research, development,
evaluation, and demonstration for secure, memory-safe CHERI-enabled systems.
CheriBSD provides spatial and referential memory safety to all software running
in userspace and, optionally, the entire operating system kernel. Future
releases will also implement CHERI-based temporal memory safety and software
compartmentalization features.
</p>
<p>
The Getting Started release is delivered as an installable image which needs to
be downloaded, written to a USB storage device, and installed on the Morello
Board. Read the <a
href="https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheribsd-getting-started/">Getting Started
with CheriBSD</a> guide to learn more how to obtain a copy of the latest release
and install it. The guide also includes information on what third-party software
is available for CheriBSD and Morello.
</p>
<p>
The best way to contact CheriBSD developers, CHERI researchers, and other
CheriBSD users is via the <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-slack.html">CHERI-CPU
Slack</a>, which includes a #cheribsd channel.
</p>
<p>
